# JetpackCompose.app

[JetpackCompose.app](https://jetpackcompose.app/) is a website that helps you
learn more about the biggest change in Android development since its inception.
It consists of tools, tutorials, resources and examples that help you level up
your Jetpack Compose knowledge.

There are 4 main sections in the website:

<table align="center" style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="screenshots/catalog_poster.png"></td>
        <td><a href="http://JetpackCompose.app/compose-catalog">Compose Catalog</a> - The most reliable source for finding the latest libraries, tools and & examples about Jetpack Compose.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="http://JetpackCompose.app/What-is-the-equivalent-of--in-Jetpack-Compose">Which Compose API to use?</a> - An IFTTT'esque tool that lets you enter an API/Widget from classic Android and makes a recommendation for the corresponding API to use in Jetpack Compose.</td>
        <td><img src="screenshots/ifttt_poster.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="screenshots/quick_bites_poster.png"></td>
        <td><a href="http://JetpackCompose.app/quick-bites">Compose Quick Bites</a> - Easy-to-consume bite sized content about the core concepts of Jetpack Compose.</td>

        <td><img src="screenshots/faq_poster.png"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Tech Stack

The website uses the following frameworks & tools:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting the site and continuous deployments
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) - CMS layer so that I can organize the
  content of the site. All the content is stored within this repo itself in json files. You can find them [here](src/data)

<br/>

The table below illustrates links you to the relevant folders for each part of
the website. **If you want to update any of the content on the site, you can
simply do so by updating the corresponding data/content json files**. It's intentionally
lightweight so that anyone can contribute.

<table align="center" style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <td>Compose Catalog</td>
        <td>
            <a href="src/components/catalog">UI Code</a> <br/>
            <a href="src/data/catalog.json">Content/Data</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Which Compose API to use?</td>
        <td>
            <a href="src/components/ifttt">UI Code</a> <br/>
            <a href="src/data/ifttt.json">Content/Data</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Compose Quick Bites</td>
        <td>
            <a href="src/components/quickbites">UI Code</a> <br/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>FAQ's</td>
        <td>
            <a href="src/components/faq">UI Code</a> <br/>
            <a href="src/data/faq.json">Content/Data</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Building the website

1. The site uses Github API for pulling the stars for github project that are added to Compose Catalog. In order to use it properly, [generate a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) and copy it.

2. Since the site uses Gatsby, it has two modes for compiling a site:

Develop - run with the `GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN_FROM_STEP_1> gatsby develop` command

Build - run with `GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN_FROM_STEP_1> gatsby build` and then `gatsby serve`
